# My neovim config
I want to keep it simple and easy to understand. Still improving it.

### Setup
- On Windows:
  ```shell
  cd $env:LOCALAPPDATA
  git clone https://github.com/maqnitude/nvim-init.lua.git nvim
  ```

Remember to get rid of `nvim` (and also `nvim-data` on Windows, `~/.local/share/nvim` on Linux) or back it up.
